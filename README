Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Get the latest software release from [1]


2a) Use dpkg, rpm or any other tool you like to install 
    the distribution specific packet (if any).

2b) If you decided to grab the source code you have to compile and
    install the flood application before usage. Create a temporary
    directory for building the binary and extract the archive there: 

Stella:~> mkdir -p /tmp/flood && cd /tmp/flood
Stella:/tmp/flood> gzip -dc .../flood-0.2.2.tar.gz | tar xf -


3) Compile the application and install the binary, documentation and
   template files: 

Stella:/tmp/flood> make
Stella:/tmp/flood> make install

Before starting the compilation you may have a short look at the
Makefile. There are some platform specific settings for Solaris.

You may need to gain administrative access rights before installation.

The default installation location is in the /usr/local/ directory
tree. You my override this with some other location:

Stella:/tmp/flood> make INSTALLDIR=/some/other/location install


Usage
~~~~~

Please have a look at the file DOCUMENTATION.
